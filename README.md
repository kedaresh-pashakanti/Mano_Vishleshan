### 🧠 Mental Health Prediction & Assistance Platform

---

## 🌟 Overview

**Mano Vishleshan** is an AI-driven mental health analysis platform that helps users understand their emotional well-being through consistent journaling.  
Users record their daily mental states over **15 days**, and our **Deep Learning model (IndicBERT)** analyzes the entries to predict potential signs of:

- 🌀 Anxiety  
- ⚡ PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder)

Based on the prediction, the system also determines the **severity level** (Mild / Moderate / Severe).  
If the result indicates a severe level, the platform **recommends certified doctors** and allows the user to **book appointments directly** through the website.
